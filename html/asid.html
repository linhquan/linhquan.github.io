	<p>Currently, I am one of the two graphic directors for the Associated Students of Interior Design. The goal of our club is to connect and help students who are interested in interior design. We usually host events, such as workshops and studio tours. As the graphics director, our job is to rebrand our club and create graphics for it. </p>

		<p>Rebranding our club was one of the main focus. We first wanted to create a new logo for our club. First we wanted to create a pictogram for our logo, however, upon further sketches and iterations we decided upon using our acronym as out logo.</p>

		<p>Our logo reinforces the idea that we are an interior design club, because it is shaped into a home, but the content (our name) is inside the house. We chose the color green, because we felt that it fit what our club wanted to be. To us, green represented our want for growth, balance, and calmness. </p>

		<h3>Flyers</h3>
		
		<p>After we established our logo, we were tasked with creating a flyer for the first general meeting we will be hosting. I wanted to explore an illustrative style for our flyer, because I felt that it would make our flyer stand out and attract more attention. We continued the theme of green into our flyer. I decided to illustrate these chairs because they are the modeled after Charles and Ray Eames chair. I also chose to illustrate a chair as a homage to our original logo idea.</p>
