	<h2>Hello!</h2>
	<p>My name is Linh.</p>
	<p>I am currently studying Design with a emphasis in visual communications at University of California, Davis. I come from Santa Clarita, California and have studied at College of the Canyons. While studying there, I earned two Associates of Art Degrees, one in Graphic Design and one in Art. I am currently living in Davis, California to pursue my education. I also hope to learn more about Design with my time at UC Davis and learn more skill sets. I also want to improve my current designing skills and my illustration skills.</p>
