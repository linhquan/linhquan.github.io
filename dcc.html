	<p class="project">As the Exhibits Team Lead of the Design Careers Club at UC Davis for the 2016 – 2017 school year, I was responsible for producing two exhibits, one for Alumni Networking Day and one for Design Career Fair. While working under a tight budget, I led a team of designers to produce pieces for the club’s largest events.

	<p class="dcc3p"> In the <a href="http://arts.ucdavis.edu/event/2nd-annual-alumni-networking-day" target="_blank">Alumni Networking Day</a> exhibit, the team created a series of “floating” frames featuring the speakers of the event. In the center of the exhibit, we created a photo booth area for the attendees and speakers to take photos with so the day can be captured and remembered. For this project, we collaborated with the graphics team for the illustrations on the photo booth and graphics inside the frames.

	<p class="dcc3p">The exhibit for <a href="http://arts.ucdavis.edu/event/3rd-annual-design-career-fair" target="_blank">Design Career Fair </a>was inspired by Lou Dorfsman’s Gastrotypographicalassamblage. In order to make the whole piece feel coherent, we limited the piece to have three typefaces, a serif, a slab serif, and a san-serif. The letters were laser cut from matte boards, hand kerned, glued onto pieces of cardboard with small supports to obtain a 3D effect. To finish this exhibit in time for the event, I hosted many work sessions during the weekend and I led team meetings to ensure we stayed on track.
